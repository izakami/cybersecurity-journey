# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Study & Lab Repository

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as I prepare for the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** certification using **only free and open-source tools**. My goal is to focus on both **theory and practical labs**, leveraging platforms like **Kali Linux**, **Raspberry Pi**, **TryHackMe**, and **Professor Messerâ€™s content**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- âœ… Master Security+ topics across all five domains
- âœ… Reinforce knowledge through labs and simulations
- âœ… Build a cybersecurity portfolio with real command-line outputs, configs, and analysis
- âœ… Share what I learn for others to benefit from too!

## ðŸ§© Domains Breakdown

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1.0** | General Security Concepts |
| **2.0** | Threats, Vulnerabilities & Mitigations |
| **3.0** | Security Architecture |
| **4.0** | Security Operations |
| **5.0** | Security Program Management & Oversight |

Each domain has its own folder containing:
- Notes (Markdown)
- Diagrams
- Command examples
- PBQ scenarios
- Lab walk-throughs

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Platforms

- **Kali Linux** (main lab OS)
- **Raspberry Pi** (network projects)
- **TryHackMe** (free labs: Pre-Security, Security+ path)
- **Wireshark** (traffic analysis)
- **Nmap**, **Nikto**, **Hydra**, **OpenVAS**, etc.
- **Penly app** for handwritten-style notes
